    Listen to the People<br /><br />
    Listen to the people that we hold high.<br />
    How many times are they going to lie?<br />
    Sooner or later they'll make you cry.<br />
    How many children are going to die?<br />
    We the people, we just sigh!<br /><br />
    The voice in your head said, "I told you so".<br />
    When it was their turn, they just said, "NO".<br />
    Voter morale is at a historic low.<br />
    Political decisions taking their toll.<br />
    Look in their eyes, Do they really know?<br /><br />
    We hear the gun shots.<br />
    We feel the pain.<br />
    We watch the blood flow.<br />
    IT IS SO INSANE!<br /><br />
    They keep telling us that they're not to blame.<br />
    But they act like it's some kind of game.<br />
    With each new day, it all stays the same,<br />
    Except for the victims, the change is their name.<br />
    And I wonder, can they feel shame?<br /><br />
    We hear the gun shots.<br />
    We feel the pain.<br />
    We watch the blood flow.<br />
    IT IS SO INSANE!<br /><br /><br />
